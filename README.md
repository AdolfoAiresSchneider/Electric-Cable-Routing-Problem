# Electric-Cable-Routing-Problem

Each instance are structured with the following pattern: The first line contains 3 integers, the number of vertices |V|, number of nets |N| and the number of edges |E|. The next |N| lines contains 4 integers ak, bk, Ak and Pk representing the vertices that need to be conected (ak and bk) with a cable with area Ak and price Bk. The following |E| lines are the edges of the graph, each one of then contains 4 integers u, v, w and c, the vertices conected by the edge (u and v), the cost w and the capacity c of the edge.
